48 THE AUTHORITY AND

year—into the Holy of Holies? What is it
that the Hebrew conscience is trying there to
express? It is the Unapproachable Sanctity
of the Being with whom we have to do. For
remember that, to the Jew, the Holy ot' Holies
Which could be entered so rarely and only with
such scrupulosity, was but the vestibule into
the very Presence of God, was but the Place
where God vouchsafed to appear not in reality,
but in a Symbol. Yet even into such a Place,
once only in a long year, one cleansed man of
a whole nation might enter, and he with soft
and trembling foot. And not even to him was
the very God made manifest. There in that
innermost solitude burned, indeed, the
Shekinah Light which bore witness that God
was present, though Invisible. But it was
away beyond, in a region far removed from
symbols, in the midst of unapproachable Sanc-
tities, girded about with light inaccessible‚ the

devout Jew conceived God Himself to be.
