PERSON OF OUR LORD 85

“the time cometh when they that destroy you
will think that they are doing God service.’'
But, notwithstanding all that, He insisted that
they who would should follow Him. “ Let a
man forsake all that he bath, and take up
his cross and follow Me.” So conscious was
Jesus 01 Η15 own identity with the living
heart 01 311 1116, 50 identified was He in His
own thought with God and God’s destiny 101
111311, 11131 He could say, ‘⁶ 11· any man come
to me and hate not his father and mother and
wife and children and brethren and sisters,
and his own life 3150, 116 63111101 be My
disciple.'' These wordS, mark you, from Him
who created the home 35 we know it, who 3150
1135 spoken the sternest words against those
who in any age would loosen 01 do violence to
its sacred bonds. Now, no one but God has
the right to claim absolute and unconditional
131111. 111 making such a claim 101 Himself,

Jesus assumed the prerogative 01 God.
