PERSON OF OUR LORD 25

way as to lead us to seek Him out of every
possible form of human impotence and despair.

6. You have, it seems to me, the Evangelical
statement of Christ's authority, and you see
it from the New Testament point of view in
a drawing of Dante Gabriel Rossetti which I
can recall.

In it we see Mary Magdalene in her un-
happy, unwise days passing down a street,
wild, unkempt‚ excited‚—when‚ looking up,
she sees a serious but kind Face, looking at
her through an open window. It is the Face of
Jesus Christ. And immediately, as she looked‚
something was struck dead within her, and
something came to life; seven devils were cast
out, and from that hour she lived a pure sweet
life, in devotion to Him who had saved her.

There you have the Unconquerable Power
of Christ. This is what shall secure the Su-
preme Place for Him so long as man has to

feel and urge his difficult way through life—-
