PERSON OF OUR LORD 35

without reserve, must be held to be proof that
now you are upon the very ground which God
all the while was meaning you to take. In
short, the thing that makes saith saith, involv-
ing secret, private qualities‚ is that it needs
something more than external evidence—in a
word, it needs the working together of a holy
Pressure upon our hearts which disposes us
to give the evidence its most radiant and
blessed Significance. As the Scripture puts it,
anticipating a thousand books and magazine
articles on the subject of the relations be-
tween saith and reason,—“ no man can say that
Jesus is the Christ but by the Holy Ghost.''
But though the persona] confession concern-
ing Christ as true Son of God‚ and Eternally
in God‚ requires something more than externa]
evidence, though it requires a certain spiritual
discernment Which enables us to give the proper
weight to the evidence, nevertheless there is

evidence, and it is not apart from the evidence
