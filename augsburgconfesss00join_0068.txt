62 PERSON OF OUR LORD

purchase unto God with Thy blood men of
every tribe and tongue and people and nation,
and madest them to be unto our God a king-
dom and priests, and they reign upon the
earth. And I saw and I heard a voice of many
angels round about the throne, and the living
creatureS, and the elderS, and the number of
them was ten thousand times ten thousand and
thousands of thousands; saying with a great
voice, Worthy is the Lamb that hath been slain
to receive power and riches and wisdom and
might and honour and glory and blessing.
And every created thing which is in the heaven
and on the earth and under the earth and in
the sea and all things that are in them heard
Ι say: Unto Him that sitteth on the throne and
unto the Lamb, be the blessing and the honour
and the glory and the dominion for ever and
ever. And the four living creatures said
Amen. And the elders fell down and wor-

shipped.''
