PERSON OF OUR LORD 111

crossing the lonely sea upon a raft, “ not with-
out risk unless,'’ the passage concludeS, “ we
can find some vessel more safe and solid,
some word from God on which we may make
this passage.” And still there is no victory
over the world, no triumphant answer to its
monotonous challenge, no personal and un-
saltering ground for hope, for living greatly
and for praise‚ except by a humble and rever-
ent confidence, nurtured on the New Testa-
ment facts, breathing the New Testament at-
mosphere of spiritual misaele and wonder, that
in Jesus Christ we have the authentic voice
from out the silence, that in Jesus Christ there

dwells for us the fulness of the Godhead in

bodily form!
Lord, open Thou our eyes—that we may

see how Awful was and is our need of the
Cominy of Thy Holy Son‚· and that we may
praise Thee for Thine overfflowing answer to

the cry of that need, world zeritlzout end. Amen.
