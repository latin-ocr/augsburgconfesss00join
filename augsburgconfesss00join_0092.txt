86 THE AUTHORITY AND

It is at this point that We can best allude
to that one fact in the sels-consciousness of
Jesus which separatcs Him from all mere men,
even from the saintliest: I mean His sinless-
ness, Jesus had no sense of moral failure.
Remorse never visited Him, or regrct for any-
thing He had ever done. In the deepest
prayers that broke from His heart, in those
awful scarchings of His own Soul which we
are permitted to overhear in Gethseman'e and
on the CrOSS‚ there is no cry of penitence‚ or
for pardon. Hc lookcd into His own heart,
and nothing in His memory had the power to
give Him pain. Hc could say, ‘⁶ I do always
the Will of my Father.'' Let us think of that,
remembering at the same time this,—that the
holier we oursclves become, the more sensitive
do we grow to the approach of sin.

Remember this, alm, which I can call to
your minds by an illustration. Perhaps you

have at some time been left in a room alone
