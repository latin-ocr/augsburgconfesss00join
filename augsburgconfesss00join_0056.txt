50 THE AUTHORITY AND

“ Keep this Commandment without spot un-
rebukable until the appearing ot' our Lord
Jesus Christ . . . who is the blessed and only
Potentate‚ the King of Kings‚ and Lord of
LochS, who only hath Immortality‚ dwelling
in the Light which no man can approach unto,
whom no eye hath seen or can see, to whom be

honour and Power everlasting.'” (1 Tim. vi.

15, 16.)

W’hatever, then, the world may make of it,
it is simply not to be disputed or qualified that
the Apostles believed and taught and the Apos-
tolie community accepted that Apprehension
of the Person of Jesus Christ which we
mean when we call Him the true and only-
begottenl Son of Geel, not to be· separated in
our thought or in the outgoing of our
hearts from Him “who is in all and

through all, and over all, God blessed for

ever.’'
