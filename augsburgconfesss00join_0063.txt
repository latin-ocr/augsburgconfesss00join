PERsoN OF oUR LORD 57

thoughts of infinite space and infinite time.
They knew that if God is, He is greater
than nature and able to take up all things in
the Hollow of His hand. S. Paul speaks to
the Romans as any serious thinker—if he were
likewise a devout man—might speak to-day:
“ that which may be known of God is manifest
in men, for God hath shewn it unto them. For
the invisible things of God from the creation
of the world are clearly seen, being under-
stood by the things that are made, even His
eternal Power and Godhead.'' Or what wider
thought of God’s Being could be expressed
than that which S. Paul (liscloses to the
Athenians: “whom ye ignorantly worship,
Him declare Ι unto you. God made heaven
and earth . . . and in Him we live and move

and have our being ''? But the Apostles had

not only a due sense of God's Almightiness;
they conceived Him always as Personal to

every man, as brooding over every human Soul.
