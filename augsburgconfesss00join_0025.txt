asked, “who art Thou?'’, He answered for
the most part, “ &Vhom say ye that I arn? ''

thing to you? Have I any influenee with you?
Do I rebuke any evil spirit within you? Do I
check some passion, or cool some sever of the
blood? Do I make it harder for you to do
wrong? Do Ι make it easier for you to do
right ?—-Then, in that case, I am so far God
to you, I am so far the Saviour for you. Act
loyally by that appreciation of me which you
yourself have formed. Let it take you as far
as it would like to take you. Be obedient to
whatever I have become for you. While ye
have light, believe in the light, and walk in it.
Do not put yourself off by raising metaphys-
ical questions. Do I impress you as the XNay
and the Truth and the Life? Do I help you
on towards what is best, or towards what at

least is better than your practice hitherto?
