76 THE AUTHORITY AND

those who first read the GospeIS, for those,
also, who first came within the stir and glory
of His mighty working in their own hearts
and in the world, the difficulty was to believe,
not that Jesus was Divine‚ but that He was, in
any sense, Human! The Church in her high
doctrine of Christ‘s Person recognises and de-
fends the final mysteriousness of it, affirming
on the one hand, that Jesus our Master was
truly man, yet at the same time claiming that
no word shall be said in any final. sense about
JesuS, no definition shall be placed upon Him,
as though it included all that is ever to be said
about Him. The Church, in her high
doctrine of Christ, claims that, though truly
man, nothing shall ever be accepted as giving
the whole truth about Him which could have
the effect ot separating Him (even by an iota)
from the Everlasting Spirit, who is at the heart
of all things, on whose Inviolable Will hang all

our hopes and fearS.
