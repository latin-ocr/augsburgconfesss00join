perils it involved, or of trampling upon the
evidence, thus giving over their souls to the
tormentors. “ Necessity is laid upon me,''
said S. Paul, ‘⁶ yea‚ woe is me if I preach not

Epistle, where Paul pours out his extraor-

a basket—there is no natural or sufficient ex-
planation of that, except the explanation of-
fered in the ninth chapter of the Acts which
tells us that once upon a time Paul, a Jevv with
the prejudices of a Jexv and the theology of
a Jew, was drawing near to that same Damas-
cus with a heart hot with disbelief and hatred,
when something felled him to the ground, and

he heard the Withstanding voice of the Exalted
Christ.
