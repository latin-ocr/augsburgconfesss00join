PERSON OF oUR LORD 51

2. And now consider for a moment that
the witness which these men bore to Christ had
the immediate effect of involving them in per-
secutions and in separations from their kin-
dred, and in apparent hostility to their coun-
try. To believe in Jesus Christ in the days
when S. Paul believed was to become an out-
cast from society, was to be reckoned a traitor
to one's own country and an apostate from
God. To believe in Jesus Christ at that time
or at any time for the next three hundred
yearS, was to put oneself in a minority‚ was
to have the proud‚ unscrupulous world against
one, was to take upon oneself the risk of pun-
ishments and death.

Surely it is the only natural and reasonable
explanation of what had happened, to sup-
pose, that when the belief in Christ's Divine
Rank was first embraced, it was embraced be-
cause it had been borne into the hearts of a

certain number of people with such a force
