PERSON OF OUR LORD 43

Son of His Love, in whom we have redemp-
tion through His blood, even the forgiveness
of sinS, who is the Image of the Invisible God,
the first—born of every Creature. For by Him
were all things created that are in heaven and
that are in the earth, visible and invisible,
whether they be thrones, or doniinions, or
principalitieS‚ or powers; all things were cre—
ated by Him and for Him; ancl He is before
all things and by Him 311 things consist.''
(Col. i. 12-16.) Or in the great passage in
the Epistle to the Philippians: “ Christ JesuS‚
who pre-existed in the form of Goel, but hum-
bled Himself to death3 wherefore also God
highly exalted Him and gave unto Hirn the
name that is above every name, that in the
name of Jesus every knee should bow, of
things in heaven and things on earth, and
things under the earth, and that every tongue
should confess that Jesus Christ is L-ord to
the glory of God the Father.''
