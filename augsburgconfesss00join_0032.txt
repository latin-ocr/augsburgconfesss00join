26 PERSON OF OUR LORD

this, that JeSUS, in virtue of what He is, has
the power to speak to us one by one, to call
us by name, by His very silence and love to
deliver us from the dominion of baser things,
and set us on our feet again. We have seen
what we have seen, and we can never be as
though we had not seen it. W'e have seen
Christ, and “that One Face, far from vanish,
rather grows! '⁹

As Marius lay dying (in &Valter Pater's
great biography), he finds himself, with that

incurable spirit of analysi5‚ trying to bring un-
der one category the many lines of influenee
which Jesus Christ was plainly exerting upon
the world, and, before death comes, he per-
ceives that “in Jesus Christ, there has been
established in this world 3 permanent protest, 3
plea, 3 perpetual afterthought which humanity
will ever possess in reserve‚ against any wholly
mean or mechanieal theory of itself and its con-

ditionS.’'
